# Email client for mentally challenged users on USB stick

**This is a work in progress and for testing purposes only**

Promoting digital independence for cognitively challenged users through a specially designed email client

Cognitively challenged users often encounter difficulties when using standard desktop systems, frequently requiring assistance from caregivers to send and read emails. They are also vulnerable targets for cyber criminals due to their tendency to believe deceptive emails. This project aims to provide a secure and accessible platform for basic online communication, tailored to the needs of these users.

## Key features

- Very simple layout for easy use
- All actions linked to photos of familiar people or large icons
- Security protection levels based on the user's mental ability
- Caregiver notifications to quickly solve problems
- Available as live ISO with persistent configuration

## User protection

Protection levels (PL) based on user mental ability

- PL3 Receiving and sending emails limited to persons defined by photographs
- PL2 Receiving and sending emails limited to whitelisted persons
- PL1 Receiving and sending emails to all persons with red alert for sensitive data in the email body
