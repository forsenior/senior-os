# Senior-OS

**This is a work in progress and for testing purposes only**

Senior-OS is a working environment for late seniors and cognitively challenged users, e.g. with Down syndrome.

Late seniors and cognitively challenged users encounter difficulties when using common desktop systems and require assistance from their caregivers. They are also easy targets for cyber criminals. This project aims to provide a working environment suitable for such users and improve their online security.

## Key features

- Very simple layout for easy use
- All actions linked to photos of familiar people or large icons
- Security protection levels based on the user's mental ability
- Caregiver notifications to quickly solve problems
- Available as live ISO with persistent configuration

## User protection

Protection levels (PL) based on user mental ability

- PL2 Web browser: browsing limited to predefined webpages
- PL2 Email client: receiving and sending emails limited to predefined persons
- PL1 Web browser: red alert when visiting a phishing web page and a copy of the phishing URL to caregiver
- PL1 Email client: red alert for sensitive data in the email body and a copy of the email to caregiver
