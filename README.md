# Senior-OS

**This work is in progress and for testing purposes only**

Senior-OS is a working environment for late seniors and cognitively challenged users, e.g. Down syndrome.

Late seniors and cognitively challenged users encounter difficulties when using common desktop systems and require assistance from their caregivers. They are also easy targets for cyber criminals. This project aims to provide a working environment suitable for such users and improve their online security.

## Key features

- Very simple layout for easy use
- All actions linked to familiar person photos or large icons
- Levels of security protection based on user mental ability
- Caregiver notifications to solve problems quickly
- Available as live ISO with persistent configuration

## Instructions

Instructions for development testing

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/forsenior/senior-os/releases). Run the Live ISO in a virtualized environment, e.g. VirtualBox and VMware, or create a bootable USB disk and boot the system directly. 

Manuals for the applications are available

## Protection levels

Three protection levels are provided based on user mental ability

- Strong for users with severe mental disability, e.g. Alzheimer's disease: browsing limited to whitelisted webpages; receiving and sending emails to/from whitelisted persons 

- Moderate for users with light to medium mental disability, e.g. Down syndrome: disabled text input on all webpages (web search allowed); receiving emails from whitelisted persons; alert on sending email with sensitive information 

- Light for users with online good-practice problems, e.g. seniors over 90: alert on phishing webpages; alert on sending email with sensitive information; caregiver email with a copy of the phishing filled-in form or sent sensitive information by email 

## Student contribution
