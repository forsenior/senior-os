# Senior-OS

Working environment for late seniors and cognitive challenged users

**This work is in progress.**

## Description

Late seniors and cognitive challenged users encounter difficulties when using common desktop systems and require assistance from their caregivers. They are also easy targets for cyber criminals. This project aims to provide a working environment suitable for such users and improve their security protection.

## Key features

- Very simple layout for easy use
- All actions linked to familiar person photos or large icons
- Levels of security protection based on user mental ability
- Caregiver notifications to solve problems quickly
- Available as live ISO with persistent configuration
 
## Environment applications

- [Email client](https://github.com/forsenior/senior-os/tree/main/smail) for senior
- [Web browser](https://github.com/forsenior/senior-os/tree/main/sweb) for senior
- [Configuraton](https://github.com/forsenior/senior-os/tree/main/sconf) for caregiver
- [App runner](https://github.com/forsenior/senior-os/tree/main/srun) for senior

## Protection levels

Three protection levels (PL) are provided based on user mental ability

PL-3 Strong Restriction - for users with severe mental impairment, e.g. with dementia

1. Browsing limited to whitelisted webpages
2. Receiving and sending emails only to/from whitelisted persons

PL-2 Moderate Restriction - for users with light to medium mental impairment, e.g. Down syndrome

1. Disabled text input on all webpages, web search allowed
2. Receiving emails only from whitelisted persons
3. Red-alert* on sending email with sensitive information (card number, password, address)

PL-1 Light Restriction - for users with online good-practice problems, e.g. late seniors over 90

1. Red-alert* on visiting phishing webpages
3. Red-alert* on sending email with sensitive information
3. Caregiver email with copy of phishing filled-in form
4. Caregiver email with copy of sent sensitive information

*Red-alert is strong visual warning
