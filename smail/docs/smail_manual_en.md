# <p align="center">User Guide for SMAIL Application</p>
## Application Control:
The application has a main control panel that contains 5 buttons for one menu (a total of 10 buttons):  
![MENU_1](https://github.com/forsenior/senior-os/blob/d88525e24efb0f307a8177733d4e23e96c085042/smail/screens/smail_menu1.png)
![MENU_2](https://github.com/forsenior/senior-os/blob/611ce63f24fb80154809f9e3b18cccd9d3b56ae1/smail/screens/smail_menu2_en.png)

1. **Menu** – allows switching between two different parts of the application (Menu 1 and Menu 2).
2. **Red button with a white cross** – is used to exit the application.
3. **Buttons with person icons** – are used to write and send messages to specific people. Pressing the button once opens the message writing environment for that person. Pressing the button again sends the message.
4. **"To" button** – works similarly to the person buttons but is intended for entering any email address if no specific person is selected.

## Viewing Emails:
• Clicking on any email in the list of received messages (Inbox) will display the selected message in the **Information and Message** window on the right side of the application.

## Writing an Email:
1. To write an email, select the **Person Button** you want to write to or use the **To** button, where you can enter the recipient's email address in the **Recipient** field.
2. In the **Subject** field, you can write a brief topic for the message (this is optional and can be left blank).
3. Write your message in the **Message** field.
4. To send, press the selected **person button** or the **To** button again (marked in green).
5. Upon successful sending, the message **"Email has been sent successfully"** will be displayed on a green background.
6. In case of unsuccessful sending, the message **"Email has not been sent"** will be displayed on a red background.
7. If you attempt to send a message containing sensitive information (e.g., passwords or card numbers), a warning message will be displayed. Pressing the **person button** or the **To** button again will send the message, including the sensitive information.
